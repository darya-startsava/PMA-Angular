## Text transcript of the presentation.
Hello,

My name is Darya Startsava. I am from Belarus, but now I live in Krakow. I study JavaScript/Front-end course at The Rolling Scopes School. This self-presentation is one of my tasks there.

So, I’d like to tell you about my education, experience in RSSchool and my goal.

I graduated from Faculty of Chemistry in Belarusian State University. I worked as a chemist in a pharmaceutical factory, and I enjoyed a lot of things in my work. When my family relocated to Krakow, I realized that I wanted to get a new profession that is in demand in most countries of the world. And I started studying at RSSchool.

My previous programming experience was limited to basic tasks in Pascal back in school. I liked solving them, and it motivated me to learn programming languages. I graduated from stage 0, it wasn’t easy, but it was cool. I started learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, got acquainted with Git, GitHub, got experience with responsive layout, worked with Figma, Bootstrap, solved JavaScript tasks from Codewars. Most of these topics were completely new for me, but it was very exciting to learn them all. On this stage I have created some interesting projects, like Slider and Photofilter, you can see them in my CV. One of requirements of Slider project was to implement the infinite slider. Due to its complexity and enjoyment of the final solution, it was one of the most memorable tasks.

I like solving JS tasks and do my best to produce the clear and effective code. I’m not easily distracted and I can stay focused for a long time. I consider myself as an effective team player who understands the importance of teamwork, collaboration and open communication. My goal is to get a job in IT as a Junior Front-end Developer after completing this course.

Thank you for your time. Have a good day. Bye.
